/**
 * Stick Ninja — the engine of the lab prototype (D-446), inspired by Stick Hero (Ketchapp, 2014): hold to
 * stretch a stick, let go and it falls across the gap; land it on the next pillar and the ninja runs over.
 * Pure functions, no DOM.
 *
 * Fair on every phone: the stick's length depends only on how long the finger was held (the press's and
 * the release's own timestamps), and where the running ninja is depends only on the time since the stick
 * fell, never on how many frames were drawn.
 *
 * Fair between players: the course (the pillars, the gaps, the slides) comes from a seed, and the page
 * seeds it with the day, so everyone who plays today crosses the same gaps.
 *
 * Units: the screen is VIEW wide; x grows to the right and a pillar is { x, w, move? }: its left edge,
 * its width, and how it slides, if it is a moving one (from MOVE_FROM on).
 *
 * A moving pillar slides back and forth while it is the one to reach; where it is depends only on the
 * time since the ninja stepped on the pillar before (`g.moveT0`). The stick is judged where the pillar is
 * when the stick lands, TURN_MS after the release, and the pillar stops right there.
